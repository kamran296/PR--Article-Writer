Additionally, you have full control over the content and presentation of your evidence, ensuring that it accurately reflects your accomplishments and qualifications.  \n\nMoreover, preparing the application yourself can save significant costs associated with hiring a lawyer. While legal assistance can be beneficial, it often comes with high fees, which may not be feasible for everyone. \n\nBy pursuing the application on your own, you can manage resources more effectively and possibly accelerate the process. If you're applying for EB1A, there could be nuances in your profile that the attorney might not grasp, but you likely can.\n\nFurthermore, personal involvement in your application allows for greater flexibility and responsiveness to any updates or changes in your circumstances. You can adapt your materials as needed and address any questions or concerns that arise promptly, without relying on a third party. \n\nFor more guidance and expert guidance throughout your EB-1A application journey consider visiting https://smartgreencard.com/.

These classifications are focused on individual merit, requiring qualifications and evidence to highlight the applicant's achievements and contributions, rather than relying on the accomplishments of the company.\n\nA company cannot deny an individual from applying for an EB-1 green card, as it is the individual's right to pursue immigration benefits based on their qualifications and accomplishments. The eligibility and approval are determined by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) based on the individual's qualifications and compliance with the specified criteria. Therefore, as long as the individual meets the criteria for one of the EB1 categories, they can pursue the green card journey.

        "content": "Several pathways exist for obtaining a green card, including Employment-Based and Family-Based green cards, Visa Lottery, Refugee Status, etc. \n\nNavigating U.S. immigration for employment-based visas requires a clear understanding of the distinct categories. Employment-Based Green Cards encompass categories like EB1 for extraordinary ability, EB2 for advanced degrees, and EB3 for skilled workers.  \nHere's a brief overview of EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 visas:\n\n1. EB-1:\nEB1A is intended for individuals with extraordinary ability. To qualify for EB1A, you need to demonstrate extraordinary ability in diverse fields such as science, arts, sports, education, and business.\n \nTo demonstrate your extraordinary ability, you need to satisfy at least 3 out of the 10 EB1A criteria and prove that you have received sustained national or international acclaim, with your achievements being recognized in your field of expertise.\n\n\n2. EB-2:\nThe EB-2 visa is tailored for individuals with advanced degrees or exceptional abilities in their respective fields. It encompasses professionals, holding advanced degrees, or those with exceptional expertise, making significant contributions to their industries. Labor certification is typically required for this category.\n\n3. EB-3:\nThe EB-3 visa is intended for skilled workers, professionals with bachelor's degrees, and other workers with less than two years of training or experience.\n\nAmong these, the EB1A category stands out as an excellent path for individuals with extraordinary abilities in fields such as sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. Unlike other categories, EB1A doesn't demand a job offer or labor certification, providing a quicker route to permanent residency for highly skilled individuals. We crafted a blog to help you understand more about the different EB1 categories. Blog link - https://smartgreencard.com/2024/02/08/eb1-green-card-categories/"

Labor Certification and I-140 Application (Employer-Sponsored):\n\nYour employer is responsible for initiating the labor certification process with the Department of Labor.\nOnce the labor certification is secured and you meet the requirements of the chosen EB green card category, you must submit an I-140 application to USCIS along with all required documentation.\nIf you meet the specific requirements of the EB green card category for which you applied, your I-140 application will be approved\n\n2. Adjustment of Status (I-485 Application):\n\nOnce your I-140 is approved and your priority date becomes available, you can file an I-485 application for adjustment of status within the US.\nUpon approval of your I-485 application, you will receive your green card.\n\nHowever, within the EB1 category, there is a subcategory called EB1A which allows individuals to self-petition their I-140 application without employer sponsorship. This means skipping the time-consuming PERM process associated with employer sponsorship. Opting for EB1A offers more control over the green card process and offers faster processing times. If you prioritize autonomy in your green card application process, EB1A might be the preferable choice for you."

EB1A doesn't require a job offer, employer sponsorship, labor certification, or an advanced degree. EB1A allows you to self-petition your green card application. Therefore, if you aim to obtain a US green card within a reasonable timeframe, I would recommend considering the EB1A Green Card path.\n\nFurthermore, I have written a blog post about the processing time required for the EB1A green card, which could be helpful to you.

The timeline for obtaining a green card through EB1A can vary, but it generally involves several steps, including the preparation and submission of the petition, followed by processing by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\n\nOne crucial factor to consider in the timeline is the priority date. The priority date is the date when USCIS receives the Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, which establishes the applicant's place in the queue for a green card. Priority dates are significant because they determine when an applicant can move forward with the final stages of the green card process, such as adjustment of status or consular processing.\n\nSmart Green Card offers assistance in navigating this journey efficiently. In the Smart Green Card VIP plan, we assist you in identifying your area of expertise and support you in all possible ethical ways to construct a compelling EB1A profile. That being said, we help you meet at least six EB1A criteria and navigate the final merits determination for EB1A success.\n\nFor more information on EB1A processing times and priority date considerations, you can visit their blog at https://smartgreencard.com/2024/02/14/eb1a-processing-time/."

Moreover, each green card category has certain requirements. You will receive your green card only when you satisfy the requirements of that particular green card category, and following that, your priority date needs to be current for your preferred green card category and country of origin.\n\nIf you are Indian, it is crucial to note that EB2 and EB3 are facing significant backlogs for India. However, EB1 has shorter green card wait times for India, and its final action dates move faster in the visa bulletins.\n\nFurthermore, EB2 and EB3 require employer sponsorship to file your green card application. However, within the EB1 category, only EB1A allows you to file your green card by yourself without an employer sponsor or job offer. You can also pursue EB1A outside the US.
